# Go utilities [![CI Status](https://github.com/JohnStarich/go/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JohnStarich/go/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/JohnStarich/go/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/JohnStarich/go?branch=master)

This is a collection of my Go utilities in one easy-to-import and easy-to-share place.

The most useful to me are:

* [covet](./covet): Reports PR diff coverage to encourage writing more tests, includes GitHub integrations
* [goop](./goop): Runs Go scripts without the fuss. Automatically builds installed Go commands when you run them.
* [gopages](./gopages): Generates static Go documentation, includes a GitHub Pages integration

And these are pretty great too:

* [datasize](./datasize): Parse, format, and convert to different units in bytes
* [dns](./dns): Implements a drop-in replacement for DNS, since Go's DNS on macOS doesn't always work
* [pipe](./pipe): Simplify error handling while keeping the original intent clear
* [plist](./plist): Parses macOS `*.plist` input data and formats them as JSON.
* [regext](./regext): Ignore whitespace and in-line comments in your regular expressions
