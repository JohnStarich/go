This is a collection of my Go utilities in one easy-to-import and easy-to-share place.

* [dns](./dns): Implements a drop-in replacement for DNS, since Go's DNS on macOS doesn't always work
* [datasize](./datasize): Parse, format, and convert to differents units in bytes
* [regext](./regext): Ignore whitespace and in-line comments in your regular expressions
